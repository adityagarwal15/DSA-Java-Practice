# 🚀 DSA Java Practice Repository

Welcome to my **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)** Java Practice Repository — created to build a rock-solid foundation in problem-solving and prepare for **MAANG/FAANG-level interviews**.

---

## 🎯 My Goals

* ✅ Master Java fundamentals + core DSA topics (Arrays, LinkedLists, Trees, Graphs, etc.)
* ✅ Practice problems daily from LeetCode, GFG, and interview books.
* ✅ Write clean, well-commented Java code for every problem.
* ✅ Build muscle memory for common patterns (two-pointers, sliding window, recursion, etc.)
* ✅ Stay consistent and track progress.
* ✅ Crack top product-based companies like **Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Atlassian, Adobe, Flipkart, etc.**
