# DSA Java Practice Repository

This repository is created to track my journey of learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) from **basics** using **Java**.

---

## ðŸ“š Goals
- Build a strong foundation starting from Java basics and simple DSA concepts.
- Solve problems regularly to improve problem-solving skills.
- Maintain well-commented, clean Java code for all solutions.
- Track progress and reflect on learning milestones.
